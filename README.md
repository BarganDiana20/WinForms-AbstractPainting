# University Project-WinForms-Abstract Painting

## Overview:  
**I created a Windows Forms application in C# capable of drawing "abstract paintings" using basic geometric shapes such as triangle, rectangle, ellipse, lines and Bezier curves. The painting can then be colored by the user, filling in the spaces between the lines. The application also allows saving the painting in jpg, png format, and printing it by clicking the print button. Technologies used: C# and Windows Forms for the graphical interface.**  

## Steps for drawing an abstract painting:  
- The user selects a geometric shape from the drop-down menu and enters the number of shapes they want to generate in the text box. By clicking the **Generate** button, the shapes are randomly created on the white drawing area. Each shape is randomly positioned and sized, resulting in unique "abstract paintings".
- To color the generated shapes, the user selects a desired color by clicking the **Color** button, then uses the **Fill** button to apply the color to specific areas by clicking on them with the cursor.
- The **ClearPage** button resets the drawing area by removing all generated shapes.
- The application provides a **ClearPage** button that resets the drawing area by removing all generated shapes.
- The user can save the generated abstract painting in popular image formats such as **JPG or PNG** using the **Save** button, enabling them to store or share their creations.
- The application integrates with the Windows printing system: by clicking the **Print** button, the user can directly print their created abstract painting.
