# University Project-WinForms-Abstract Painting

**I created a Windows Forms application in C# capable of drawing "abstract paintings" using basic geometric shapes such as triangle, rectangle, ellipse, lines and Bezier curves, selected by the user. The painting can then be colored by the user, filling in the spaces between the lines. The application also allows saving the painting in jpg, png format, and printing it by clicking the print button. Technologies used: C# and Windows Forms for the graphical interface.**
